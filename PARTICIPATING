Commits template
----------------

Commits descriptions should follow a specific template. 
It will help us when we will extract some commit information and enable us to have 
a common standard. This is pretty simple and requires just 2 lines at most.
Here is the template:
Summary: <Description of the commit>
Ticket: <Ticket ID>

The description of the commit describe the context of the change. What is this doing and why.
The ticket ID is the ticket number this change is related to, if the corresponding ticket exists.
